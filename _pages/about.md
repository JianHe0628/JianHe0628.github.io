Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD Candidate at [CVSSP, University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing), specializing in Computer Vision. My research focuses on advancing Sign Language Recognition and Translation by harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). More specifically, I'm looking for ways to leverage LLMs for understanding and processing sign language as LLMs have taken over the world due to their impressive language capabilities. I'm currently working under the supervision of [Professor Richard Bowden](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/richard-bowden) and I hope the fruits of my PhD will help improve communication and accessibility for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.
